SUFTware (Statistics Using Field Theory) provides fast and lightweight Python
implementations of Bayesian Field Theory algorithms for low-dimensional
statistical inference. SUFTware currently supports the one-dimenstional
density estimation algorithm DEFT, described in [#Chen2018]_,
[#Kinney2015]_, and [#Kinney2014]_. The image on the right shows DEFT applied
to alcohol consumption data from
the World Health Organization. This computation took about 0.25 seconds on
a standard laptop computer.

Code for this and other examples can be found on the :doc:`examples` page.
The :doc:`tutorial` page contains a short tutorial on how to use SUFTware.
The :doc:`documentation` page details the SUFTware API.

Installation
------------

SUFTware can be installed from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/suftware>`_ using the pip package
manager (version 9.0.0 or higher). At the command line::

    pip install suftware

The code for SUFTware is open source and available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/jbkinney/suftware>`_.


Quick Start
-----------

To make the figure shown above, do this from within Python::

   import suftware as sw
   sw.demo()
